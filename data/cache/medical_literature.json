Houseflies are strongly suspected of transmitting at least 65 diseases to humans, including typhoid fever, dysentery and cholera. Flies regurgitate and excrete wherever they come to rest and thereby mechanically are the root cause for disease organisms. A case of oral myiasis caused by Chrysomya bezziana in the maxillary anterior region in a 40-year-old patient is presented. Manual removal of maggots, and surgical debridement of wound was done followed by broad-spectrum anti-parasitic medications. A note on the identification of the larva and histopathology of the tissue is also highlighted here.", "authors": ["Jimson S", "Prakash C A", "Balachandran C", "Raman M"], "publication_date": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "journal": "Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research", "keywords": [], "doi": "10.4103/0970-9290.127626", "orpha_code": null}]}
